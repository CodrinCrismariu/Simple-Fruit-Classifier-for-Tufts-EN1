This is a simple implementation of a 1-Layer MLP that's been trained using backpropagation with 64x64 black and white banana and apple images that can classify if your drawing is a banana or an apple. You can run the main program that has a simple UI made with tkinter in which you can save images and train the model on them. If you want to train it on something else other than bananas and apples just delete the weights file and draw your new type of images to train it on.
